Welcome to my digital history. Here you can learn a little bit about me, read my thoughts and <ins>maybe</ins> understand where I'm coming from.

The purpose of this website is not only for me to document my thoughts but also create an archive for the evolution of my thoughts. I have always been a believer of holding strong opinions loosely, so strap in and see how far I've come.

Let's hope you found something useful during your time here. If not, let's at least hope you have something to show your friends and laugh about.
