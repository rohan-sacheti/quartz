I used to be an avid reader, unfortunately, that has declined over time. This is my attempt to hold myself accountable and slowly increase the number of books I read.

Additionally, I have been told that I only read _popular books_ I can see where that comment come from. So in that spirit, if you do have recommendations for me feel free to submit it on this [form](form.link). Bonus points if it's a dystopian novel!
