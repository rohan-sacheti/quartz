### Product Manager @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/): 2021-Present
I'm building products that drive efficiency across Azure. My role on the team is to identify, areas of hardware, software, and personnel inefficiencies within Azure and ideate and deploy products to alleviate them.
Interned as a Product Manager on a Robotics team. Built the roadmap to deploy Robots in our Datacenter and delivered a proof of concept platform that enabled us to test deploy on virtual (synthetic) renderings of Azure datacenters. This PoC let us simulate the behavior of the robot in the datacenter without needing to physically deploy it. As a consequence we sped up the development time considerably.
